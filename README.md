# Project Ft_printf

## Module 1 of 42 Common Core

### Main Objective

You have to recode the printf() function from libc. It has to handle the following conversions `cspdiuxX%`,
without implementing the buffer managment from the original function.

- `%c` Prints a single character.
- `%s`Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
- `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
- `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
- `%i` Prints an integer in base 10.
- `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
- `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
- `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
- `%%` Prints a percent sign.

In this project we are allowed to use libft.
